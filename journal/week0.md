# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

1. Created a Budget and Billing Account on my 2nd AWS Acct. Prior that, I was able to link my debit card for possible expenses. This was easy to follow from the videos provided by Andrew. This would be easier if practiced often. 

2. Creating a gitpod account is also something new to me but given there is a video on how to do it, this would be an easy task.
